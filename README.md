# NEWS
Whatever you do, do NOT star the repo it is forked from. Cosmos has completely removed all forms of credit to me, and my contribution access.

The forked repo in this link is the official repo, if you had starred the old one, undo it.

Do NOT support the original repo!

Cosmos backstabbed me after all my workon Cosmic, and thats just a shitty thing to do.

DO NOT HARASS COSMOS

This is not meant to start a witchhunt.
# What is greatsword?

This is the sequel to GreatSword v1 (deleted). Greatsword was a proxy I made, but it had very outdated scripts compared to new tech. 
<br>
I made this repo to hopefully modernize Greatsword, and keep its feel.
<br>
Please star if you enjoy, it helps this repo grow.

# IMPORTANT
In order to use "unsafe" Greatsword V2 links you must put your pointer in the middle of the "deceptive site" screen, and type "thisisunsafe". This may redirect you to a new tab, or something else. You may have to go back to the same site and repeat this process up to 10 times. Eventually it will become usable.

# Current bugs:
* Chrome safe browsing may falsely flag links.
* If this happens, about:blank cloak reports as "unsafe" and typing "thisisunsafe" does not work.
